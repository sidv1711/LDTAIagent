# Legacy Streamlit Application

The original Streamlit frontend has been replaced with a modern Next.js application.

## Legacy File

- `app_streamlit_legacy.py` - Original Streamlit application (moved for reference)

## Migration Complete

The application now uses:
- ✅ **Next.js Frontend** - Modern React-based UI in `frontend/` directory
- ✅ **FastAPI Backend** - RESTful API server in `api_server.py`
- ✅ **Same Python Agent** - All core functionality preserved

## Running Legacy (Not Recommended)

If you need to run the old Streamlit version for comparison:

```bash
# Install streamlit
pip install streamlit

# Run legacy app
streamlit run app_streamlit_legacy.py
```

**Note**: The legacy Streamlit app may not work correctly as it expects direct imports that have been refactored for the API architecture.

## Benefits of New Architecture

- **Better Performance**: Faster load times and interactions
- **Modern UI**: Professional design with responsive layout
- **Scalability**: API-based architecture allows multiple frontends
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between frontend and backend
- **Real-time Features**: Live status updates and interactive chat

**For the current application, use the Next.js frontend at http://localhost:3000**
